# Navigating the Databricks Data Science and Engineering Workspace

This demo will explore the Databricks Data Science and Engineering Workspace. By the end of this lesson you will be able to:
* Describe the Databricks architecture and its services
* Navigate the Data Science and Engineering workspace

## Home page

Go over the different sections of the home page. Be sure to highlight the `What's new` section that provides information on the current and historical Databricks versions, as well as a service status dashboard. Mention that there are handy links to perform some common tasks, all of which are available elsewhere in the UI. Finally, call out to the `Quickstart Tutorial` which is a great resource for getting started with a Notebook.

## Sidebar

The sidebar contains links to different sections of your Workspace. The links available depend on the service selected in the persona switcher.

## Persona switcher

Use the persona switcher to demonstrate switching to Databricks SQL and Databrics Machine Learning. Highlight that you can pin a selection to make it the default when logging in to Databricks.

### Icons

Explore the various icons. In particular:
* Open the **Create** menu for creating common assets
* Show the **Workspace** file browsing functionality. Show user and home folders at a minimum. Display the options available at folder and file levels. Discuss how permissions can be applied to folders within this structure to facilitate a secure, collaborative Workspace.
* Make a forward mention of **Repos**. While Repos apply the same functionality and UI metaphors as the Workspace, they deliver git integration.
* Highlight that **Recents** can be used to revisit recently accessed assets, and make it easier to switch between Notebooks in a single tab.
* Make a forward mention of **Data**, which will be used to explore tables and files used for processing.
* Make a forward mention of **Compute** for managing your clusters
* Make a forward mention of **Jobs** that can be used to non-interactively execute and schedule workloads.

## Help

Explore the different resources available under the **Help** item.

## Settings

There are three distinct sections for settings.

### User Settings

Highight that this is where we go to update passwords, personal acess tokens, integration with a git server, and various settings related to your Workspace.

### Admin Console

For sufficiently privileged users, this option is available to administer various aspects of the Workspace. Configure global settings, create users, groups, permissions; set global cluster initialization scripts.

### Manage Account

Configure your Databricks account.

## Menu options

Show the options to contol behaviour of the sidebar.

## User menu

Highlight the option used to log off or switch Workspaces, when multiple Workspaces are configured.
